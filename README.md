# rtsp-test
Not nearly a production solution -- only saved this here as a proof of concept for streaming live RTSP feed to HLS (via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgWVm_j3llo)

The goal is to stream RTSP camera feeds to the browser in a nice looking way -- maybe like video.js -- that can be contained in a \<video\> tag (i.e., not in an \<img\> tag like most tutorials do it). Kinda annoying how RTSP isn't natively supported in browsers.

Used an Apache server locally for testing.
